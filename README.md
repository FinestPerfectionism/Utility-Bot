# Utility-Bot
## Github for Utility Bot. Contains Alpha and Beta versions.

I'm really not sure why you'd want to use this bot, like ever, but in case you do, make sure to change the constants to align with what your roles, guild, and channel IDs in constants.py.

As far as I know, not much else needs to change in the bot for you to be able to host it, but take that with a grain of salt.
