# Utility-Bot
## Github for Utility Bot. Contains Alpha, Beta, and Release versions.

I'm really not sure why you'd want to use this bot, like ever, but in case you do,
- Change the IDs in constants
- Change instances of "Utility Bot" into whatever you wish
- Change instances of "The Goobers" into your guilds name.
- Define TOKEN in an a .env

As far as I know, not much else needs to change in the bot for you to be able to host it, but take that with a grain of salt. Please remember that this bot only works in a single guild.

Please read the LICENSE file for more information on how I would like my work distributed, altered, and used.
