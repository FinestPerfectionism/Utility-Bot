                "Administrators operate under the direction of the Directorate. When in doubt about the scope or intent of an instruction, seek clarification before acting. Do not interpret broad directives speculatively — precision matters in infrastructure changes.\n\n"
                "### §7.4 Coordination with the Moderation Team\n"
                "When an infrastructure change may affect moderation workflows — such as modifying ticket channels, alert channels, or bot command access — notify the Moderation Team in advance where practical. Changes that disrupt active moderation operations without prior notice are disruptive and should be avoided.\n\n"
                "### §7.5 Rollback and Errors\n"
                "If a change produces an unintended result, report it to the Directorate immediately and document what changed and what went wrong. Do not silently correct mistakes through further undocumented changes.
